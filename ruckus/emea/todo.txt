Marcel,

By the way the files I uploaded just now are older, I'm planning to be upload current files with more complete functions today. I'm focusing on the JS and dynamic functions today. The files I sen tare just to show I'm working on the website.

I will upload files tonight at 23:00 - 01:00 so you will find files tomorrow morning.

Regards.
Luthando

Emails/ Hours R8400:

To me it looks like it might take 1 - 4 weeks at 8 hours a day to finish up the work but I would like us to meet.
1 week if it's minor css, HTML and responsive changes.
2 - 4 weeks if it's a lot of JavaScript work that needs to be done fro the User Experience.


HTML / W3C Optimization / Popups HTML - 8 hours  (21 February 2018)
CSS - 4 hours (22 February 2018)
Animations - 4 hours (22 Febraury 2018)
JavaScript Debugging, recoding and Charts/ JS - 8 hours (23 February 2018)
Responsive Design - 16 hours (26 February 2018 - 27 February 2018)

40 hours




Hours 2, 5 March- 9 March

Hours per task:
1. Event and Users not click-able (1 - 4 hours):
    (Events:
 https://t4.cloud.ruckuswireless.com/t/0015000001EhrO3AAJ/#/tenant/0015000001EhrO3AAJ/events
  /  Users:
 https://t4.cloud.ruckuswireless.com/t/0015000001EhrO3AAJ/#/tenant/0015000001EhrO3AAJ/users/devices)

Note: This depends on what I need to do. Do have to create the pages or do I only have to link them to existing live pages.




2. Venue can't be clicked into (first venue: 1 level drill-down (4 hours) :

 https://t4.cloud.ruckuswireless.com/t/0015000001EhrO3AAJ/#/tenant/0015000001EhrO3AAJ/venues/venue-details/My-Venue/venue-overview)

Note: I will have to get the design for this pager and the UX. Also the password for the the original site does not work for some reason. I get kicked out, it would be great to access the page.





4. The guide shows up every-time you go to the main dashboard page  -
any possibility to allow the guide to show up only the first time when
a user lands onto the dashboard? (4 hours):

I will have to use cookies for this function.



5. Network doesn't add anything to the list when you create it (but
the button works now). The same for Add AP and add Venue - can we
please make the dummy data to work e.g. when a network is created - it
will create a new network and populate accordingly (8 hours - 16 hours).

Depending on what the client needs. Does he need it to actually save data in the Database or does he need it just to display dummy data? I can use JavaScript to create a dummy User Experience which is 8 hours or I will have to use PHP and MySQL to create the real deal which might take 16 hours. I would prefer  someone else to do the PHP and MySQL.



Summarized breakdown:

-Event and Users not click-able (1 - 4 hours):

-Venue can't be clicked into (first venue: 1 level drill-down (4 hours) :

-Popup up once (4 hours):

-Network doesn't add anything to the list when you create it (but
 the button works now).(8 hours - 16 hours).


Hours = 28 hours (3 1/2 Days)

It's going to take 3 and a half days.
